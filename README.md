# terraform-provider-env0

Terraform provider to interact with env0

Available in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/env0/env0/latest)

The full list of supported resources is available [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/env0/env0/latest/docs).

## Example usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    env0 = {
      source = "env0/env0"
      version = "0.0.2"
    }
  }
}

provider "env0" {}

data "env0_project" "default_project" {
  name = "Default Organization Project"
}

resource "env0_template" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "Example template"
  repository  = "https://github.com/env0/templates"
  path        = "aws/hello-world"
  project_ids = [data.env0_project.default_project.id]
}

resource "env0_configuration_variable" "in_a_template" {
  name        = "VARIABLE_NAME"
  value       = "some value"
  template_id = env0_template.tested1.id
}
```

## Authentication

First, generate an `api_key` and `api_secret` from the organization settings page.
See [here](https://docs.env0.com/reference#authentication).

These can be provided by one of two methods. First method consists of setting `ENV0_API_KEY` and `ENV0_API_SECRET` environment variables, and just declaring the provider with no parameters:

```terraform
provider "env0" {}
```

The second method would be to specify these fields as parameters to the provider:

```terraform
variable "env0_api_key" {}
variable "env0_api_secret" {}

provider "env0" {
    api_key = var.env0_api_key
    api_secret = var.env0_api_secret
}
```

## Dev setup

To build locally, you can use the `./build.sh` script.
The rest of the steps below are relevant if you would like to use the provider outside of the test harness (the test harness performs the steps described here).

To use local binary version, you'll need to create a local terraform provider repository.
The simplest way to do so would be to create a folder on your disk.
Under that folder, copy the built provider binary to `terraform-registry.env0.com/env0/env0/6.6.6/linux_amd64/terraform-provider-env0` (note to replace linux_amd64 if using a different platform).
Then, create a `terraform.rc` file (location doesn't matter).
The content of said file should look like so:

```
provider_installation {
  filesystem_mirror {
    path    = "<absolute path to local repository folder>"
    include = ["terraform-registry.env0.com/*/*"]
  }
  direct {}
}
```

Finally, set an environment variable `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` to point to the `terraform.rc` file created.
After that, `terraform init` should be able to locate the provider on disk.
To define this variable only when running terraform once, you can, in bash shell:

```bash
TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=<terraform.rc path> terraform init
```

## Testing

### Harness
If you have `ENV0_API_KEY` and `ENV0_API_SECRET` environment variables defined, after building the provider locally, just run `go run tests/harness.go` to run all the tests. Make sure to run from the project root folder.

Use `go run tests/harness.go 003_configuration_variable` to run a specific test.
The last argument can also be specified as a full path, e.g., `tests/003_configuration_variable/`.

Each test perform the following steps:

- `terraform init`
- `terraform apply -auto-approve -var second_run=0`
- `terraform apply -auto-approve -var second_run=1`
- `terraform outputs -json` - and verifies expected outputs from `expected_outputs.json`
- `terraform destroy`


The harness has two convineint modes to help while developing: If an environment variable `DESTROY_MODE` exists and it's value is `NO_DESTROY`, the harness will avoid calling `terraform destroy`, allowing the developer to inspect the resources created, through the dashboard, for example.
Afterwards, when cleanup is required, just set `DESTROY_MODE` to `DESTROY_ONLY` and _only_ `terraform destroy` will run.

### Unit Testing
#### How to run tests
Run from root directory:
```shell
go test ./...
```

#### How to use mocks
1. Make sure to add this line in files that include the interface you'd wish to mock:
```
//go:generate mockgen -destination=<file>_mock.go -package=<package> . <interface>
```

2. Run from root directory:
```shell
go generate ./...
```

## Documentation
- Docs are generated using github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs
- Run `./generate-docs` to generate docs
- Must be run manually before releasing a version

## Release
- To release a version to the Terraform Public Registry, create a Release+tag that matches semver (d.d.d)
- Docs must be generated manually and committed to the repo before release.
- Binaries will be automatically generated by `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- The Registry will automatically pick up on the new version.
