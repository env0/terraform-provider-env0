# terraform-provider-env0

Terraform provider to interact with env0

Available in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/env0/env0/latest)

The full list of supported resources is available [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/env0/env0/latest/docs).

## Example usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    env0 = {
      source = "env0/env0"
      version = "0.0.2"
    }
  }
}

provider "env0" {}

data "env0_project" "default_project" {
  name = "Default Organization Project"
}

resource "env0_template" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "Example template"
  repository  = "https://github.com/env0/templates"
  path        = "aws/hello-world"
}

resource "env0_configuration_variable" "in_a_template" {
  name        = "VARIABLE_NAME"
  value       = "some value"
  template_id = env0_template.tested1.id
}
```

## Authentication

First, generate an `api_key` and `api_secret` from the organization settings page.
See [here](https://docs.env0.com/reference#authentication).

These can be provided by one of two methods. First method consists of setting `ENV0_API_KEY` and `ENV0_API_SECRET` environment variables, and just declaring the provider with no parameters:

```terraform
provider "env0" {}
```

The second method would be to specify these fields as parameters to the provider:

```terraform
variable "env0_api_key" {}
variable "env0_api_secret" {}

provider "env0" {
    api_key = var.env0_api_key
    api_secret = var.env0_api_secret
}
```

## Dev setup

### Build 
- Use the `./build.sh` script.
- The output binary is called `terraform-provider-env0`

### Run local version of the provider
- Build - `./build.sh`
- Create the plugins folder - `mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.env0.com/local/env0/6.6.6/darwin_amd64`
- Copy the built binary - `cp ~/env0/terraform-provider-env0/terraform-provider-env0 ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.env0.com/local/env0/6.6.6/darwin_amd64` (Replace `darwin` with `linux` on Linux)
- Require the local provider in your `main.tf` - 
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    env0 = {
      version = "6.6.6"
      source  = "terraform.env0.com/local/env0"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Integration tests
- The integration tests run against the real env0 API 
- Have `ENV0_API_KEY` and `ENV0_API_SECRET` environment variables defined.
- Also set `ENV0_API_ENDPOINT` if you want to run against a non-prod environment.
- Run `go run tests/harness.go` (from the project root folder) to run all the tests.
- Use `go run tests/harness.go 003_configuration_variable` to run a specific test.

Each test perform the following steps:
- `terraform init`
- `terraform apply -auto-approve -var second_run=0`
- `terraform apply -auto-approve -var second_run=1`
- `terraform outputs -json` - and verifies expected outputs from `expected_outputs.json`
- `terraform destroy`

The harness has two modes to help while developing: If an environment variable `DESTROY_MODE` exists and it's value is `NO_DESTROY`, the harness will avoid calling `terraform destroy`, allowing the developer to inspect the resources created, through the dashboard, for example.
Afterwards, when cleanup is required, just set `DESTROY_MODE` to `DESTROY_ONLY` and _only_ `terraform destroy` will run.

### Unit Testing
#### How to run tests
Run from root directory:
```shell
go test ./...
```

#### How to use mocks
1. Make sure to add this line in files that include the interface you'd wish to mock:
```
//go:generate mockgen -destination=<file>_mock.go -package=<package> . <interface>
```

2. Run from root directory:
```shell
go generate ./...
```

## Documentation
- Docs are generated using github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs
- Run `./generate-docs` to generate docs
- Must be run manually before releasing a version

## Release
- To release a version to the Terraform Public Registry, create a Release+tag that matches semver (d.d.d)
- Docs must be generated manually and committed to the repo before release.
- Binaries will be automatically generated by `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- The Registry will automatically pick up on the new version.
