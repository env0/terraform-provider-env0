# env0 Provider

The [env0](https://www.env0.com) provider is used to interact with the resources supported by env0. The provider needs to be configured with proper credentials before it can be used. Please refer tho [this guide](https://developer.env0.com/docs/api/YXBpOjY4Njc2-env0-api#creating-an-api-key) on how to generate those credentials.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Terraform 0.13+ uses the Terraform Registry:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    env0 = {
      source = "env0/env0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the env0 provider

provider "env0" {
  api_key    = var.env0_api_key
  api_secret = var.env0_api_secret
}
```
